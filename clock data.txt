the estimated time let it be 
10 30 
and the real time let it be 10 34
then what is the percentage of accuracy?
how many revolutions is 10 30
it is 10 plus .5
so thats 10*60 + 30 mins
and the game is about minute accuracy so it should make sense to count the mnutes for the percentage of accuracy
630 mins and the real time was 1- 34 so thats 634 mins
that means teh guy is mistaken by 4 mins
so anyways we know that 4 + or 4- that means the same level of accuracy
like if the answer is 5 and you choose 4 its the same as choosing 6
so lets assume the smaller one for simpler calculations
so let it be 626 mins 
and so ( 624 / 630 ) * 100 = 99 %
